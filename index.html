              E-mories is a distraction free and personalised communication platform that allows you to keep 
              in touch with close friends and family when unable to meet in person. As a decoration for your 
              home, the sphere illuminates your room in soothing colours when a close friend or family member 
              sends you a message.

            <p>
              Our team was tasked to conceptualise and build a novel physical interaction, with or through 
              technology, that should be designed for playful and open-ended interactions in everyday life.

            we chose to explore the domain Emotional Intelligence. In short, Emotional Intelligence
            is our ability to recognise emotions, know how to act in social settings, empathise and 
            self-motivate

          <h3>Research Question</h3>
          <p>
            After having conducted background research and initial user interviews, we devised the 
            following research question:
          </p>
            <blockquote>
              "How can we encourage others to share positive emotions with close ones remotely?"
            </blockquote>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section>
        <article class="article-body">
          <h3 class="no-margin-top">E-mories</h3>
          <p>
            In response to the brief and domain, we built a set of physical devices to facilitate personalised 
            one-to-one asynchronous communication that would blend into your home. E-mories are provided in pairs, 
            one for you and one for your close friend or family member.
          </p>
          <h3>How it Works</h3>
          <p>
            To send a message using E-mories you simply:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>Squeeze</em> to record your message;</li>
            <li><em>Rotate</em> to browse through colours; <span class="changes">(changed from shake)</span></li>
            <li><em>Squeeze</em> to lock in the colour which best represent the mood of your message, and;</li>
            <li><em>Throw</em> up in the air to send your message</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            After you've sent your message, your friend's E-mories will start to glow the colour you chose 
            in step three. They can then proceed to listen to your message by squeezing their E-mories device.

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
              As shown in the interaction plan and explained through our mantra, E-mories intends to facilitate 
              sharing positive emotions with close-ones remotely. When an E-mories ball lights up, it acts as a 
              tangible representation of the sender and their mood, illuminating your home with soothing colours. 
              Although users are free to use E-mories for whatever they like, it is our belief that a colour with 
              happy connotations sent from a close friend will brighten people's day. Moreover, we believe that 
              when receiving a negative colour, people will empathise and take care of each other, thus helping 
              each other back to a positive state of mind. In handing the reins over to the user and giving 
              people the agency to define their mood through colour, meaning that they entrust onto the receiver 
              a sneak peek into their state of mind, which is to be decoded using their shared meaning of that colour.
            </p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
              For some, E-mories may provide a personal style of communication among two people, while others may 
              want to use E-mories to convey meaningful messages to show close-ones how important they are to them. 
              E-mories can offer a new and exciting medium for tech enthusiasts, or for those of us who feel like 
              social media can be overwhelming, it can be a much needed decluttered and simplistic platform. 
              E-mories isn't for one particular person or audience, but rather for people who share the situation 
              of wanting a personal, meaningful and distraction free communication platform.

              When building E-mories, we chose to explore each our aspect of the overall product to rapidly user test 
              different features of the product. We then used the knowledge gained from these individual explorations 
              to build one common solution. Although all prototypes currently have all functionality in common, we are 
              still actively user testing different aspects of the overall concept and therefore have built slight 
              variations of the same product to gather more usability data. The focus of my prototype exploration is to 
              find a suitable method for notifying users of incoming messages, a suitable interaction for playing the 
              incoming audio message, and whether E-mories can amplify a shared experience between people, even when 
              shared remotely.

              Our background research, initial interview and first prototype test led me to the current solution which utilises 
              squeeze to listen to recordings, pulsating lights to display notifications and haptic feedback to emphasise when 
              a user interacts with the E-mories device. Moreover, for this prototype, I have used a transparent rubber ball 
              filled with glitter water to explore a suitable material for E-mories and how to make the device a personal 
              artefact for the user,by providing a

            <h3>What's Working & What's Simulated?</h3>
            <p>
              All audio playback for my prototype and recording for Thomas’ prototype had to be simulated due to one piece of 
              hardware we found to be faulty, meaning that we can't play or record audio messages from within the ball. Although
              audio is a core feature of the prototype, we will still be able to gather the data we need by simulating audio. 
              The features we have working are the squeeze interaction to record and listen to messages, a notification system 
              for incoming messages, a colour picking system, and sending and receiving data to the other E-mories devices in our team
              through a server.

              from a set of initial concepts that was presented in class. One domain that emerged was from this exercise 
              was Emotional Intelligence, which our team formed around. As an initial concept, we came up with the idea
              <span 
                class="inline-link"
                onclick="window.open('https://youtu.be/bnUceLbmCUI', '_blank', 'noopener')">
                Emotional Birds,
              </span>
              a game revolved around in-the-moment emotions. Emotional Birds would let users choose a ball to throw 
              representing a specific emotion and then try to hit a target. The combined data from velocity and colour 
              of the ball would drip a similar coloured drop of water into an oil tank which would represent that user's 
              in-the-moment emotion for all bystanders to see. Based on 
              <span 
                class="inline-link"
                onclick="window.open('https://deco3850.uqcloud.net/blogs/week-4-pivot-and-idea-refinement-5e82cad9c73e7', '_blank', 'noopener')">
                feedback
              </span>
              we received, it became apparent that Emotional Birds did not fully meet the brief of being an everyday activity. 
              Some of the feedback we received at this stage is part of the final prototype as presented on this website. 
              These are, to let users make their own mixture of emotions, combined from clay or colours, move the concept 
              into the home to meet the everyday aspect of the brief, and to combine senses such as exploring shape, material 
              and colour together. We decided to pivot our project and instead came up with a cylinder containing one ball 
              per person in a household. This cylinder would track the household’s emotions throughout the day and act as 
              a mediator to talk about emotions in the home. However, we still had to out how to make the concept more interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
              To better understand our concept and potential users, we conducted an interview with young adults to understand their 
              emotional sharing habits. Our 
              <span 
                class="inline-link"
                onclick="window.open('https://deco3850.uqcloud.net/blogs/week-5-post-2-user-interviews-and-concept-proposal-5e8addd9f31fc', '_blank', 'noopener')">
                findings
              </span>
              showed that people were uncomfortable talking about their emotions and that they mostly talked about emotions with 
              those closest to them.

              Another interesting finding was that people did not intentionally sit down to talk about their positive emotions either. 
              This sparked the idea of focusing on sharing positive emotions to get meaningful conversations going. After looking more 
              closely at what we wanted users to leave with after having used our concept, we ended up focusing on <em>lifting the spirit 
                in the home</em>. This goal was further refined to <em>encourage positive emotional sharing with close-ones remotely</em>, 
                which is when the concept of

                class="inline-link"
                onclick="window.open('https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZKv8h9r98Bvlkw7q9M-Ia4Yj9mWBKuqo?usp=sharing', '_blank', 'noopener')">
                E-mories emerged.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              At this stage we started to work on our individual explorations while at the same time developing the overall concept 
              together. As for my exploration, I drew upon the work of Boothby, Clark and Bargh to explore whether E-mories could 
              provide a personal enough connection for people to share emotions and whether sharing an experience from remote could 
              enhance the experience for those sharing in it

              . Moreover, I set out to explore a suitable interaction for listening to recordings and a suitable notification system. 
              From the initial interview and our background research, we had already decided to start off with prototyping squeeze as 
              an interaction for recording and listening to audio, shake to determine colour and throwing to send data. Moreover, we 
              had decided to prototype colours as a notification of incoming messages and implement a microphone and speaker for audio 
              recording and playback. When building the

                first prototype,
              </span>
              it turned out that we had some faulty hardware, thus making it difficult to implement audio into the ball itself, which 
              is the reason audio is simulated. Findings from user tests indicated that the E-mories, in its current form, do not 
              enhance a remotely shared experience, material needs to be explored, and colours are perceived differently from person 
              to person, although there are some similarities. The squeeze interaction and notification lights were generally well 
              received except for some minor fine tuning required for the next prototype.

              people’s perspectives. The

                feedback
              </span>
              we received on the presentation, mostly correlated with our user test findings from before. As with the user test 
              findings, here too our feedback suggested that we should explore material in addition to looking at how we could 
              make E-mories more of a personal artefact. Moreover, one team suggested that we should focus on one-to-one 
              communication instead of small groups of devices connected.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the second prototype, I listened to the feedback we had received and focused on exploring a suitable material 
              for E-mories. Wanting to test both form and material at the same time, I tried to create a semi-translucent cube 
              out of silicone, but when the mixture still hadn’t dried after several days, I started over from scratch. For the 
              next attempt I chose to use a rubber ball from K-mart. This ball had an interesting pattern to it and contained 
              glitter water inside which I thought could make for a neat effect if light illuminated it in the correct way, 
              which I could user test to see if it makes E-mories more of a personal artefact than the previous prototype.

              Ideally, E-mories would make use of several mediums and senses to form a combined memory from various sources. 
              These data sources could be a combination of smells, images, movie clips, touch and more, as together, they 
              would play to several different human senses. An interesting technology to implement would be electro tactile 
              feedback to allow users to feel various materials when touching the E-mories device, such as the fur of your 
              dog while replaying a happy memory of your pet. Additionally, my ideal solution would also allow for E-mories 
              devices to replay old memories and build upon them with new memories, either from friends reflecting on their 
              memories together or when one of them is visiting the same place again. Moreover, I would like to see a 
              functionality which encourages users to interact with old memories as they slowly fade over time if not 
              interacted with, and for people to store memories that are important to them, to be revisited at any time. 
              However, given that we are not designing for ourselves, the ideal product may look entirely different to our 
              users than what an ideal product looks like to its designers. So far in our process, we haven't uncovered any 
              ideal solution from the users’ perspective in our findings. Although, users are, for the most part, happy with 
              how the device have turned out so far.

              E-mories is built using an Arduino Uno connected over serial to a local JavaScript client which in turn connects 
              via a web socket to a Node.js server.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/technical.png" alt="Image showing the five steps included in sending a message">
            <p>
              This server’s job is to retrieve messages when they have been sent from one computer and to forward the message 
              to the correct receiver. The server is a standard node.js server using the express framework and socket.io library.
            </p>
            <p>
              The client is the layer that ties the server and Arduino together. It’s a locally run JavaScript file that retrieves 
              and sends data over the serial port to and from the Arduino in addition to sending and retrieving data from a web 
              socket connection to the server.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Arduino is set up to control the E-mories ball and all of its sensors. Inside of the ball, there is a MPU6050 
              Accelerometer using the MPU6050_tockn library,a NeoPixel strip using Adafruit_NeoPixel library, a bend sensor and 
              a haptic vibration motor. We use the accelerometer when choosing a colour to accompany the message and to throw the 
              ball in the air to send the message, as these movements require us to observe

              the ball’s rotation and acceleration. To display notifications, show visual feedback when recording and picking a colour, 
              we use the LED strip to display coloured lights. The bend sensor is what allows us to sense when a user squeezes the ball, 
              and the haptic vibration motor lets us use vibration as feedback to let users know when something is happening.
            </p>
            <p>
              A typical sequence would be that a user records a message using the E-mories ball using the bend sensor to indicate to the 
              system that he or she wishes to record a message. When done recording the user presses the bend sensor a second time to let 
              the system know that it has been completed. Next, the user will pick a colour by tilting and rotating the accelerometer, 
              before they again press the bend sensor to let the system know they have picked a colour. Lastly, he or she throws the ball 
              in the air, again using the accelerometer which indicates to the system that the message should be sent. The Arduino sends 
              the message and colour over to the JavaScript file on the computer through the serial

              port (USB). The JavaScript file forwards the data to the server via a web socket connection where it’s final destination will 
              be determined and sent off to. The server then sends the data to the receiving computer over a similar web socket connection 
              which is caught by an identical JavaScript file as to the first computer. When receiving information from the server, this 
              file forwards it to another Arduino connected to its serial port. The Arduino then uses the LED strip to indicate that an 
              incoming message has been received.

              All team members have built their E-mories ball slightly different as we are still testing various aspects of the overall concept. 
              My ball is built using a transparent rubber ball filled with all previously mentioned Arduino sensors covered in silicone and then 
              filled with glitter water. The glitter water is intended to, in combination with the LED light, create interesting reflections 
              which is one way of making the device more of a personal artefact for some users.

              The obvious challenge of the ideal product, being similar to the memories of the movie Inside Out, is its complexity. Where the final 
              prototype display emotions using lights, uses haptic feedback to enhance the feeling of interacting with the ball and relies on audio 
              as its medium, memories from Inside Out have a far more complex combination of mediums to convey meaningful memories. One point of 
              having an ideal product is to have a goal that is just out of reach to strive for. Although the state of E-mories is far from its ideal 
              self, we have successfully been able to user test a subset of the ideal product and found it to be a useful path to pursue. There is no 
              doubt that implementing more mediums than audio alone would drastically alter the product and how users could interact with it and what 
              it could be used for. Therefore, to fully explore the ideal product, where its value lies and whether it would serve as a meaningful 
              alternative to existing solutions, a more comprehensive prototype ought to be built. The desired outcome of the project has changed 
              several times throughout the design process and due to restricted user testing conditions, we had to be flexible in terms of choosing 
              what aspects to test that would provide us with the most valuable data. Where our team has been successful in combining all our 
              prototypes to one, thus allowing us to communicate remotely with our E-mories devices, and found promising data, other goals were more 
              difficult to reach, such as testing the effects of haptic feedback and feel of materials.
