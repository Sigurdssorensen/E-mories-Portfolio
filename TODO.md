  [X] describe intended experience;
  [X] including a brief statement of the problem being 
      addressed by the project, from a team and individual perspective.

<!-- [X] Describe/illustrate the technical & physical make-up of the final product
  [X] Describe & illustrate the technical and physical form of the   
      prototype, considering that some visitors are keenly interested in what is happening behind the scenes.
  [X] Describing the materials used in the physical form will help
